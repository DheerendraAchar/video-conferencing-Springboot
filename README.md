The Video Conferencing Web Application using Spring Boot, Lombok, and the ZEGOCLOUD API aims to create a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform for real-time communication. This project serves as a comprehensive solution for enabling virtual meetings with high-quality audio and video streaming while offering essential collaboration features.
The backend is developed using Spring Boot, providing a robust framework for handling user authentication, session management, and meeting room functionalities. The use of Lombok streamlines the development process by reducing boilerplate code in entity, DTO, and service layers, ensuring efficient backend implementation. RESTful APIs are used for seamless communication between the frontend and backend, enhancing modularity and maintainability.
By integrating the ZEGOCLOUD API, the application delivers real-time voice and video communication with low latency and high reliability. Features such as multi-participant support, screen sharing, and adaptive streaming enhance the user experience. Core functionalities include secure user registration and login, room creation and management, participant controls, and in-call text chat for better collaboration.
